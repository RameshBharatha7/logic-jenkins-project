<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Welcome to Jenkins</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Jenkins is an open-source Continuous Integration server written in Java for orchestrating a chain of actions to achieve the Continuous Integration process in an automated fashion. Jenkins supports the complete development life cycle of software from building, testing, documenting the software, deploying, and other stages of the software development life cycle.</p>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">What is Continuous Integration?</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Continuous Integration is a process of integrating code changes from multiple developers in a single project many times. The software is tested immediately after a code commit. With each code commit, code is built and tested. If the test is passed, the build is tested for deployment. If the deployment is successful, the code is pushed to production.</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">This commit, build, test, and deploy is a continuous process and hence the name continuous integration/deployment.</p>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Advantages of using Jenkins</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Jenkins is being managed by the community which is very open. Every month, they hold public meetings and take inputs from the public for the development of Jenkins project.</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">So far around 280 tickets are closed, and the project publishes stable release every three months.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">As technology grows, so does Jenkins. So far Jenkins has around 320 plugins published in its plugins database. With plugins, Jenkins becomes even more powerful and feature rich.</p>
